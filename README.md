A mobile-first, starter theme for the [Genesis framework](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=242694&u=316166&m=28169&urllink=&afftrack=).

Genesis Starter is meant to be a starter theme that's quick and easy to use and adapt in your own projects. There is no Grunt, Bower, Composer and other tools that add to the learning curve for the theme. The exception is [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and the [Bourbon mixin library](http://bourbon.io). Sass is a great starting point to level up your web development skills, and [Treehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/blogjunkie) has some great courses for you to get started. Not ready to dig into Sass? Just edit `style.css` directly.

Overview of theme structure

* `includes/genesis.php` contains many common code snippets which can be easily enabled by uncommenting them.
* The files in the `includes/structure` directory mirror the ones in `genesis/lib/structure`.
* Keep plugin integrations as portable as possible by requiring `includes/integrations/plugin.php`
* Just testing out code and don't want to bother sorting? Put it in `includes/shame.php`

Credits to [Bones for Genesis 2.0](http://github.com/cdukes/bones-for-genesis-2-0) by cdukes for the file organization and many of the included snippets.
